[![iso_build](https://github.com/radxa-build/rockpi-s/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/radxa-build/rockpi-s/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## What is this?

A collection of auto-generated images for Rock Pi S.

Rockchip released a new SoC revision (RK3308B-S), and all board produced in 2022 and after are based on this revision.
You can identify the SoC revision by the chip marking: RK3308B-S will have `RK3308B` written on the chip instead of `RK3308`.

* Armbian image will have name started with `Armbian`.
* Radxa debos image will have name started with the board name.</br>
  Support RK3308B-S since [2022/04/01](https://github.com/radxa-build/rockpi-s/releases/tag/20220401-0343).
* Legacy Radxa debos image can be found [here](https://github.com/radxa/rock-pi-s-images-released/releases).

## Where can I download the image?

Built images are uploaded to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/radxa-build/rockpi-s/releases/latest).
