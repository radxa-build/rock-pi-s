## What is this?

This repo is the central location for Radxa-built system images for ROCK Pi S.

## What images are provided?

Currently 4 flavors are provided:

- Debian KDE: This flavor is officially supported, tested, and recommended for all users.
- Debian CLI: This flavor is officially supported. This flavor is quite minimal and is intended for headless usage. We do not support desktop usage on top of this flavor.
- Ubuntu KDE: This flavor is provided as-is except for critical issues. Users should look at Debian KDE as an alternative.
- Ubuntu CLI: This flavor is provided as-is except for critical issues. Users should look at Debian CLI as an alternative.

Please also always use [the latest release](https://github.com/radxa-build/rock-pi-s/releases/latest) instead of any pre-release / test builds. Those will not be supported.
